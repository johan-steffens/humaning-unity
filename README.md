# Humaning!
##### A fishing game where you catch humans! Made for Weekly Game Jam #93

This game is the first game that I've made in two years, and as such had me rush to get it finished in time! If you have any suggestions or fixes, please create a pull request with your changes so I can merge them into the master branch.
